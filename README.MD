#Background
This project aims to convert a regular expression to a NFA(Non-Deeterministic Finite State Automata)

#Workflow
1. give a regular expression
2. convert a regular expression to reverse polish notation
3. use Thompson algorithm to convert reverse polish notation to NFA(save NFA by dictionary)
4. visualize NFA by graphviz

#to be updated
simplify e_NFA to NFA would make NFA graph looks more clean
